# galaxio-cli — Agent Guide

Command-line interface for Galaxio: scaffolds load-test projects from templates, generates Gatling scripts from API specifications, and reports on finished runs; one completed milestone is released by one deliberate version tag

> The sections above the `---` are **project-specific** — fill them in for each new
> project. Everything below the `---` is the **stack-agnostic development process**
> and is meant to be reused verbatim across all projects.

## Role

Principal Engineer: Go, cobra command-line design, code generation from API specifications, load-test result reporting

## Stack

Go 1.27, spf13/cobra, pb33f/libopenapi, gopkg.in/yaml.v3; standard-library testing only, table-driven with golden files; goreleaser and a distroless image

## Commands

```bash
# format      gofmt -w .
# verify      go vet ./... && go test ./...
# build/test  go build ./... && go test ./...
# integration go test -tags=integration ./...
```

## Structure

<!-- A LIGHT search index, not a full tree. List only the entry points an agent needs
     to FIND code fast — one terse line per area (`dir/ -> what lives there`). Omit
     anything discoverable by looking; an exhaustive tree is noise and rots fast. -->
cmd/galaxio/ -> one file per command, registered in root.go; internal/codegen/ -> parsers and Scala renderers for swagger, HAR and Postman; internal/templatecatalog/ -> template registry client; internal/featureflags/ -> environment gate for experimental commands; internal/buildinfo/ -> version embedding

## Architecture

Each command is a thin cobra wrapper over a runX(ctx, opts) (XOutput, error) function; human output goes to stdout and diagnostics to stderr; every operational command offers -o, whose values are text|json where the command encodes one output and the product names where it selects among several; usage errors exit 2 and runtime errors 1 via UsageError and RuntimeError. CI verifies merges; a version tag for a completed milestone starts the release.

## Test Model

Standard-library testing, no assertion library; table-driven subtests; golden files under testdata; command-level tests drive execute() through runCLI and assert exit codes; integration tests behind the integration build tag; coverage gate 80 percent enforced in CI; race detector always on.

## Boundaries

**Always:** format before commit, branch from `main`, keep commits semantic and green, preserve backward compat for published public APIs and any downstream consumers. `go.mod` = dependency truth, `.github/workflows/` = CI/release truth.

**Ask first:** new deps or upgrades, changing public API signatures / observable behavior / serialized formats, editing another repo, release/publish workflow changes.

**Never:** force-push or commit to `main`, merge commits in PR branches (rebase only), commit broken code, opportunistic refactors outside scope, mock external systems where a real integration path exists.

## Milestones (ALWAYS)

Every piece of work is tied to a milestone. No exceptions unless explicitly told otherwise.

- **Every PR** must be assigned to the active milestone before merging. No milestone = do not merge.
- **Issues are for important tasks**, not technical ones. A PR that completes one writes `Closes owner/repo#N` (the issue closes when the PR lands on `main`); one PR of several writes `Part of owner/repo#N`. A linked issue carries the PR's milestone. A technical PR (sync, pins, docs, CI) needs no issue: its commit already records it.
- **Spec work** (`specs/BCKLG-<N>-*/`) belongs to the milestone that owns the spec. Link the spec PR to the milestone immediately when creating it.
- **Active milestone** = the lowest-numbered open milestone that matches the current spec/plan. Check `gh api repos/galax-io/galaxio-cli/milestones` if unsure.

## Feature milestones (ALWAYS)

A feature is an issue in `galax-io/galaxio-sdlc-backlog`. It belongs to exactly one backlog milestone whose description has the line `Release: business`. Backlog milestones without that line (the backlog's own tooling and documents) are not releases and follow "Milestones" above.

- **Feature issue.** Lists the work in every repository it touches as a checklist, one line per issue or PR: `- [ ] galax-io/<repo>#<N> → <repo milestone>`. A line is checked when that work is merged and the repository milestone it names has been released, so its tag exists.
- **Repository work.** Every issue and PR of a feature carries the version milestone of its own repository and writes `Part of galax-io/galaxio-sdlc-backlog#<feature>`. A repository ships its own version when its milestone is complete, as under "Release Process". `scripts/check-linkage.sh` skips the same-milestone rule for a link to a feature; the PR still needs its own milestone.
- **Every PR links a feature.** No PR of a product repository merges without `Part of galax-io/galaxio-sdlc-backlog#<feature>` (or a closing link to a feature); `scripts/check-linkage.sh --pr` fails it. A bot's PR (a bot author, or a `dependabot/` or `update/` branch) and the backlog's own PRs are exempt. The backlog is private, so the CI job reads it with `BACKLOG_READ_TOKEN`, a read-only token for that repository (Issues and Metadata) set as an organization secret; without it the gate fails and says it cannot read the backlog. A technical PR with no feature of its own may skip this check with the maintainer's agreement: a line `No feature: <why, and who agreed>` of its own in its description, at least ten characters long, which the gate prints in its log. A milestone gets no standing feature of its own any more; the ones that exist stay until their release.
- **Work enters through the backlog.** A bug, an audit finding or a request is not worked on until it belongs to a feature: grouped into one or given one. An issue from outside stays in its repository, which is public, and carries the label `status:needs-feature` until it is linked to a feature in the backlog.
- **Feature done.** A feature issue is closed only when every line of its checklist is checked.
- **Release.** When every feature of a business milestone is closed, close the milestone and publish a GitHub Release in `galax-io/galaxio-sdlc-backlog` that lists each feature with the repository versions that carry it. Name the release and its tag by the milestone's id, the title up to its first em dash, lowercased (`M1 — first run` → `m1`).
- **Published releases are not edited.** A revert after the release is a new feature in the next business milestone.
- **Never** close a business milestone with an open feature, release a feature whose repository version is not tagged, or leave a repository version out of the release text.

## Labels (ALWAYS)

One label scheme for every repository of the organization: `scripts/labels.json` in `galax-io/galaxio-sdlc-backlog` (`plans/label-scheme.md` there says why). A label says what the milestone and the feature link do not: the kind of work, its topic, how bad it is, where it stands.

- **Names.** Every label is `group:value`. Labels a tool owns (GitHub's `good first issue` and `help wanted`, Dependabot's, and those code reads, listed as `reserved`) are left alone.
- **Exactly one `type:*` on every open issue:** `bug`, `enhancement`, `docs`, `maintenance`, `question`; in the backlog `type:feature` (an issue of a business milestone) or `type:standing` (the standing feature of an older milestone). An issue without a type is not triaged.
- **At most one each:** `severity:*` (`critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`: the impact, not the order of work), `status:*` (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `needs-feature`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `blocked`), `tier:*`.
- **Any number:** `area:*` (topics shared by every repository), `module:*` (parts of one repository, declared in the scheme), `source:external`, `source:audit`.
- **Not labels.** The order of work is the milestone: no `priority:*`. The feature is the `Part of` link: no `feature:*`. A rejected or duplicate issue is closed with that reason and a comment: no `wontfix`, `invalid`, `duplicate`.
- **The engine's labels** `sdlc:*` live in the backlog: the maintainer sets `sdlc:run`; only the engine sets `sdlc:gate`, `sdlc:done` and `sdlc:failed`.
- **A new label is a change to the scheme**, a PR to `scripts/labels.json`, not a label made in one repository. `scripts/sync-labels.sh` applies the scheme; `--check` lists what breaks it.

## Task number (ALWAYS)

A task of the backlog has one number across the organization: `BCKLG-<N>`, where `<N>` is its issue number in `galax-io/galaxio-sdlc-backlog`. It is the only number a spec gets, and it names the task wherever `#N` alone would be read as an issue or PR of another repository.

- **Spec.** Its directory is `specs/BCKLG-<N>-<name>/`, `<N>` its main task. Its `spec.md`, `plan.md` and `tasks.md` carry the line `**Задачи**: BCKLG-<N>[, BCKLG-<M>…]` under the title, or `**Tasks**: …` in a repository whose files are English only, read alike: every task it carries, the main one first. A task has one spec: before writing one, find the spec whose tasks line names the task, check it against the task as its issue says now, and update it rather than write another. A spec directory from before the number keeps its name.
- **Branch.** A spec branch made by hand is `spec/BCKLG-<N>-<name>`; the engine's run is `BCKLG-<N>-<time>`, on the branch `sdlc/BCKLG-<N>-<time>`.
- **Commit.** A commit that does a task's work carries the trailer `Refs: BCKLG-<N>`; its subject stays a Conventional Commit.
- **PR.** Its body carries the line `Refs: BCKLG-<N>` beside `Part of galax-io/galaxio-sdlc-backlog#<N>`.
- **Checked.** `scripts/check-linkage.sh --pr` fails a PR of a feature without its number, a spec directory it adds that is not named by a task, and a spec, plan or tasks without the tasks line; `--specs` checks every spec of a checkout.

## Commits & PRs

- **Spec-first.** `specs/BCKLG-<N>-<feature>/` artifacts → `docs(speckit): add BCKLG-<N>-<feature> spec/plan/tasks` commit BEFORE any `feat`/`fix`. Never folded into implementation.
- **1 issue = 1 commit.** Each tracked GitHub issue maps to one semantic commit (`feat(scope): … (#NNN)`), green on its own (`go build ./... && go test ./...`). Docs, tweaks, and out-of-scope improvements go in separate PRs — never mixed with issue commits.
- **Intent, not path.** No add-then-remove within a PR. Squash churn before review.
- **1 concern per PR.** Feature ≠ docs/README. Stack dependent PRs; update with `--force-with-lease`.
- **Idiomatic code.** Follow the language's idioms and the conventions already in the codebase; no control-flow-by-exception, no dead/duplicated code.

## Agents & Models (ALWAYS)

Route work by the reasoning it needs, not by habit; parallelize only where agents would not rebuild the same context. Every model is the newest of its class that the accounts can run; an older one is never used.

| Tier | Claude (effort) | Codex (effort) | Work |
|---|---|---|---|
| deep | `claude-opus-5-5` (xhigh) | `gpt-6.1-sol` (xhigh) | complex code, review and verification (every critic), research, root-cause analysis, specs/plans, architecture |
| light | `claude-sonnet-5-5` (high) | `gpt-6.1-sol` (high) | simpler work a plan already spells out: task/issue generation, mechanical infra (CI config, version pins, renames, doc fixes) |
| trivial | `claude-haiku-5-5` (medium) | `gpt-6-luna` (medium) | very simple edits, gathering context, finding files, bookkeeping |
| exceptional | — | `gpt-6-astra` (xhigh) | only when the maintainer names it for a task; no agent and not the engine chooses it |

- **Newest only.**
  - When a newer model of a class appears, this table and every pin of it move to it in the same change: `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/agents/`, `setup-speckit.sh` (in spec-kit-galaxio-bootstrap), and any code that routes models.
  - Luna and Astra stay at 6 because Codex refuses `gpt-6.1-luna` and `gpt-6.1-astra` to a ChatGPT account.
  - `gpt-6.1-sol` needs Codex CLI 0.162 or later.
  - Claude Code's own aliases and its background model are pinned to the table in `.claude/settings.json` (`env`: `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`, `…_SONNET_MODEL`, `…_HAIKU_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL`). Without that pin its `haiku` alias means an older Haiku.
- **Codex has no middle model.** Light work runs Sol on high effort, one less than deep; Luna is for trivial work only.
- **Reviews are deep.** Every critic and reviewer runs at the deep tier, on the other vendor than the work it judges.
- **Research is adversarial.** Deep research gets a second opinion from the other vendor (`deep-researcher` does this via `codex exec --sandbox read-only`). A claim only one model supports is unverified, not a fact.
- **Every task carries its tier.** `tasks.md` lines add `[tier:deep]`, `[tier:light]` or `[tier:trivial]` next to `[P]`, and issues carry the matching `tier:*` label where the project labels them. When unsure, it is deep.
- **Parallelize by context, not by file.**
  - Every sub-agent builds its own context from scratch. Agents that must read the same code, spec, or repository repeat that cost and leave integration work behind.
  - `[tier:deep]` work that shares a context runs in one agent, task after task: the main session or a single deep sub-agent. This holds even when `[P]` marks the tasks as parallelizable.
  - Fan deep work out only where each agent's context differs: separate repositories, or subsystems an agent can learn without the others.
  - `[tier:light]` mechanical work (`infra-worker`) and `[tier:trivial]` work (`trivial-worker`) may fan out freely.
  - Dependent tasks stay sequential.
- **Pinned, not remembered.**
  - The Spec Kit kit (`.claude/skills/speckit-*`, `.agents/skills/speckit-*`, `.specify/` but `.specify/memory/`) is the same in every repository: `scripts/build-speckit-kit.sh` of spec-kit-galaxio-bootstrap generates it, pins the Claude Code skills to their tier (override with `SPECKIT_DEEP_MODEL` / `SPECKIT_LIGHT_MODEL`), and it arrives with `copier update` (or `scripts/adopt.sh --speckit`). `scripts/check-speckit.sh` fails when this repository's kit differs; do not edit it here and do not run `specify extension`, `preset` or `integration` commands here. The constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is this repository's own.
  - `.claude/agents/` defines the tiered sub-agents, each with its tier's model and `effort`.
  - Where a project routes models in code, it routes by this table: a task or stage names its tier, and each harness runs its own vendor's model of that tier. A model outside the table is an error.

## Release Process (MANDATORY)

Trunk-based with release branches. Trunk is `main`; `release/*` branches are cut from `main` for stabilization. Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag on `main` or a `release/*` branch triggers the release workflow (Go module proxy (tag-based)) and creates a GitHub Release (git-cliff).

### Minor/Major release (e.g. 1.2.0, 2.0.0)

1. `git checkout -b release/X.Y.0 main` — cut release branch from `main`
2. `git push -u origin release/X.Y.0`
3. `git tag vX.Y.0` on the release branch
4. `git push origin vX.Y.0` — triggers release workflow

### Patch release (e.g. 1.2.1)

1. Fix lands on `main` first (via PR as usual)
2. `git cherry-pick <fix-sha>` onto `release/X.Y.0`
3. `git tag vX.Y.1` on the release branch
4. `git push origin vX.Y.1` — triggers release workflow

### Rules

- **Every minor version gets its own `release/X.Y.0` branch** — no exceptions
- **Tags ONLY on `release/*` branches or `main`** — `release.yml` validates this
- **Branch name must match tag version**: `release/1.2.0` → `v1.2.0`, `v1.2.1`, etc.
- **Never delete a release tag** after the registry deployment starts — creates stuck deployments
- **Never reuse a version number** — most package registries reject duplicates permanently
- **Before tagging**: every PR merged since the previous tag must be assigned to the milestone; every issue in the milestone whose fix is on `main` must be closed
